# Big Like, Great Disappointment
Have you ever had a romantic encounter in your life before?
Don't even answer that, you're in the right place.

Big Like, Great Disappointment is a romantic visual novel from your own perspective. Your goal is to get someone to go on a date with you, and maybe do even more.

Along the way, you will meet various "deep" and "realistic" characters who may or may not develop an interest in you and depending on your choices, you might even get romantically involved with them.

# This game is still in development (obviously) so the storyline or characters may change at any time
